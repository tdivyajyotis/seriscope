## SeriScope: A low cost edge-AI system for fertility and disease assessment of Tassar silkworm eggs

**Pebrine is caused by ***Nosema bombycis***** and is the most destructive disease in silkworms. It
historically devastated European sericulture in the 18th century. Even today, if infection is found,
entire batches of eggs are destroyed. This leads to serious financial losses for farmers. Current
detection methods depend on looking at moth body fluid under a microscope. This manual
process is prone to errors and takes a lot of time, requiring skilled technicians. Misdiagnosis can
result in the unnecessary destruction of healthy moths or the release of infected ones.

**Our project, SeriScope**, introduces a diagnostic system that uses AI to detect pebrine infection
through automated analysis of microscopic images. The system employs **Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs)** trained on **1400 real samples collected from our fieldwork**. It classifies samples
as either **pebrine-positive or pebrine-negative** with high accuracy in just minutes. By combining
image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning, the system spots the unique spore
shape of pebrine that people often miss.

The edge-AI model we propose is designed for low-cost local use in sericulture testing centers.
It can run offline on microcomputers like Raspberry Pi. By automating diagnostics, SeriScope
greatly cuts down on the need for manpower, lowers testing costs, and shortens analysis time. At
the same time, it improves reliability and supports sustainable silk production.
